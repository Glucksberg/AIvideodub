On a March night in 2025, a simple 48-year-old IT operator was leaving a bar in São Paulo when he was suddenly stopped by a friendly man who wanted to talk about the operator’s work. Days later, he received a call from the same man, offering 5,000 reais for access to his work systems. Tempted by the offer, the middle-aged man accepted. Four months later, that same man would be arrested, accused of launching the largest cyberattack in Brazilian history. But the big question is: how did a single key in the hands of a mere technician open a door that millions in technology should have kept locked? How did that small spark start a one-billion-real fire? Well, in this video, we’re going to unravel this mystery.

A hacker attack. A billion-real hacker attack. A hacker attack.

This hacker attack can be considered the largest in the history of the national financial system. It cost over one billion reais. It’s being called the heist of the century.

To execute a theft of this magnitude, the first question the criminals asked themselves wasn’t “How do we hack the bank?” but rather “What’s the easiest path to the money?” The answer wasn’t in the big banks, with their digital walls and specialized security teams. The answer was in their suppliers—those providing essential services who didn’t always have the same level of protection.

This is where CEM Software comes in. The cyberattack targeted CEM, which provides services to banks and fintechs alike. It offers a service known as Banking as a Service, acting as a technology bridge that connects dozens of smaller financial institutions to the Central Bank’s payment system. Attacking a big bank head-on is like trying to break into the vault door. Attacking CEM is like robbing the armored truck en route—a classic tactic known in the security world as a supply chain attack.

The target was set. Now came the second part of the plan: how to get inside the armored truck? The easiest way was with help from someone already inside. They needed an employee, an insider.

Nowadays, finding an employee of any company is frighteningly easy. A simple LinkedIn search reveals dozens of people proudly listing CEM Software as their employer: directors, managers, analysts, and IT operators. To the gang, that list wasn’t just a roster of employees. It was a menu of potential targets. And in that list, one profile in particular stood out—not for its experience, but precisely for its lack of it. An alleged newcomer to the field.

But he wasn’t your typical junior IT guy. He was a 48-year-old man who had spent 20 years as an electrician and four as a cable TV technician. At 42, he’d decided to invest in a college degree and switch to information technology. On his LinkedIn profile, he wrote: “By my age, many expect to already be in a C-level position. But I’m here, eager to start over, with the sparkle of a youngster in my eyes, ready to give my best and learn everything I can.”

And it was on him that the gang found their golden ticket: João Nazareno Roque—the alleged key to the largest cyber theft in Brazil.

Everything was very well thought out. According to Roque’s testimony, negotiations took place via WhatsApp calls on a phone that was swapped out every 15 days, and payments were made through motorcycle couriers. João had no idea who was buying his credentials—and at first, that was all they wanted. But the attackers soon realized that the employee’s passwords alone were useless. To use them, they needed access to CIEM’s internal network, which was only possible through a corporate computer with a VPN or by being inside the company’s building.

Facing this barrier, two weeks after the first negotiation, they offered the employee another 10,000 reais to execute some commands on his corporate computer. And well, he agreed again. When he used the equipment, he’d review some notes and enter the commands—believed to be malicious code. Under the hackers’ direction, he downloaded Notion, an online note-taking app that was used to deliver the code to Roque.

It’s somewhat unclear which commands were executed. My theory as an ethical hacker is that these commands allowed the hackers to access the IT operator’s computer remotely. It was then used for pivoting: an attack where a compromised machine is used to access an isolated environment—in this case, CIEM’s internal network.

Some investigations concluded that an internal server housing client certificates had a vulnerability known since 2023. This critical flaw allowed remote access to that server, which in itself is a major problem. A 2023 vulnerability still present in a high-risk system is no joke. But it didn’t stop there. This server contained unprotected certificates used by clients to authenticate with the Brazilian payment system. So far, it’s not clear whether that flaw was actually exploited or if João’s credentials already granted access to the server containing those certificates. What is known is that those certificates shouldn’t have been there in that state, and they were the much-coveted key the attackers needed to carry on with the scheme.

Up until that point, several security procedures had either been ignored or completely bypassed. And with João’s help, they managed to infiltrate the company without having to contend with most of its defense mechanisms. Yet even so, they stayed in the company’s internal network for days. They executed commands on a corporate computer and supposedly breached a highly sensitive server—all without alerting any security teams. Which, well, is at the very least bizarre.

But what was to come was even more bizarre. Armed with those legitimate certificates, they issued payment orders against the reserve accounts of financial institutions. These reserve accounts held massive funds and were used when necessary. In the early hours of July 1, 2025, these reserves began to drain. Since these transactions were signed with trusted certificates, they went through without raising major alarms. This allowed the criminal group to divert roughly one billion reais.

From the system’s perspective, everything was happening legitimately, which to this day makes it difficult to measure exactly how much money was stolen. By the attackers’ skill or CIM’s oversight, nobody had noticed the theft. But the attack didn’t end there. They still had to launder the money.

Hundreds of transactions were made to various straw accounts, which then needed to convert all that money into cryptocurrencies—allowing the group to spend it untraceably. For that, they used various cryptocurrency exchanges to handle the conversions. But what they didn’t count on was that SmartPay exchange was on high alert. On the morning of the attack, they identified suspicious behavior and reported it to the authorities. The exchange noticed a strange spike in account creations over a short period, and what caught their eye was the massive, coordinated demand for crypto assets coming precisely from those newly created accounts.

Although those accounts were frozen after the report, it’s estimated the group escaped with around 200 million reais worth of crypto assets. So far, no member of the group has been identified or arrested—unlike the former CIM employee, who was arrested on the night of July 3, 2025, and now faces a lengthy sentence, possibly up to 20 years in prison.

João is suspected of having received 15,000 reais to help with this scam. According to his testimony, he confessed to collaborating with other individuals and assisted them in accessing the system that carried out the Pix transfer requests directly to the Central Bank. It’s suspected that at least four young people were involved in the attack; more may have been involved.

The Central Bank didn’t stand by: it suspended three financial institutions suspected of having received funds from the attack, and it’s now investigating whether they had any ties to the criminals. On Sofi Pagamentos’ “Reclame Aqui” page—the profile of one of these under-investigation companies—we can see that in recent days numerous new complaints have been filed about data misuse, unauthorized account creations, Pix transactions they didn’t recognize, and similar issues, which is quite strange.

Sofi received around 200 million reais intended to be converted into cryptocurrencies. And a point that’s drawing a lot of attention is that the owner of this fintech, who received millions, was just a cook until recently—and only became the sole partner of the company in May of this year after purchasing all the shares for one million reais. The company belongs to Estevam Pais Bastos, who on social media identifies himself as the owner of a fish distributor in Campo.
