On a March night in 2025, a humble 48-year-old IT operator was leaving a bar in São Paulo when he was suddenly stopped by a friendly man who wanted to talk about the operator’s job. Days later, he received a call from the same man, offering him 5,000 reais for access to his work systems. The middle-aged gentleman, tempted by the offer, ended up accepting. Four months later, that same man would be arrested, accused of launching the biggest cyberattack in Brazil’s history. 

But the big question is: how did a single key in the hands of a simple technician open a door that millions in technology should have kept locked? How did this small spark ignite a one-billion-reais fire? Well, in this video we’re going to unravel that mystery.

A billion-real hacker attack? This hacker assault can be considered the largest in the history of our national financial system—it netted over one billion reais. It’s being called the “heist of the century.” To pull off a theft of that magnitude, the first question the criminals asked themselves wasn’t “How do we break into the bank?” but rather “What’s the easiest path to the money?” The answer wasn’t in the big banks, with their digital perimeters and specialized security teams. The answer lay with their suppliers: those providing essential services but not always enjoying the same level of protection.

This is where CEM Software comes in. The cyberattack targeted CEM, which serves banks and fintechs. It offers a service known as Banking as a Service, acting as a technology bridge that connects dozens of smaller financial institutions to the Central Bank’s payment system. Attacking a major bank head-on is like trying to crack open a vault door. Attacking CEM is like hitting the armored truck on its way. It’s a classic tactic in security circles known as a Supply Chain Attack.

The target was chosen. Now came phase two of the plan: how to get inside the armored truck? The easiest way? Recruit someone already inside. They needed an insider.

Nowadays, finding an employee of any company is frighteningly easy. A quick LinkedIn search reveals dozens of people who proudly list CEM Software as their workplace—directors, managers, analysts, IT operators. To the gang, that list wasn’t just a directory of staff; it was a menu of potential targets. And among that menu, one profile shone brightest—not for its experience, but precisely for its lack of it. A supposed newcomer to IT. But he wasn’t your typical junior. He was a 48-year-old man who’d spent 20 years as an electrician and four as a cable-tv technician. At 42, he’d decided to invest in a degree and switch to information technology. On his LinkedIn profile he wrote: “I’m at an age when many expect to already be in C-level roles. But I’m here, eager to start over, with the sparkle in my eye and the energy of a kid to give my best—and learn everything I can.” And it was him the gang identified as their golden ticket.

João Nazareno Roque: the alleged key to Brazil’s biggest cyber heist. Everything was meticulously planned. According to Roque’s testimony, negotiations happened via WhatsApp calls on a burner phone swapped every 15 days. Payments were dropped off by couriers. João had no idea who was buying his credentials—and at first, that was all there was. But the attackers quickly realized that his passwords alone were useless. To use them, they needed access to CIM’s internal network—which required a corporate computer with VPN or physical presence in the company building. Two weeks after the first deal, they offered him another 10,000 reais to run some commands on his corporate machine. And he agreed again.

In this incident, he’d open the equipment, glance at some notes, and type in commands—what we believe were malicious codes. Under the hackers’ guidance, he downloaded Notion (an online note-taking app) to receive and execute the scripts. Exactly which commands were run is a bit uncertain. My theory, as an ethical hacker, is that those commands let the attackers remotely access the operator’s computer, then use it for pivoting—a tactic where a compromised machine serves as a bridge into an isolated network. In this case, CIM’s internal environment.

Investigators later found that an internal server—hosting client-used certificates—had a vulnerability known since 2023. That critical flaw allowed remote access to the server, which alone is a massive security lapse. A 2023 vulnerability still lurking in a high-risk system? Not something to take lightly. But it got worse: that server stored unprotected certificates clients used to authenticate to Brazil’s payment system. To this day, it’s unclear whether the vulnerability was directly exploited or João’s stolen credentials already granted access to those certificates. What is certain is that those certificates shouldn’t have been stored there unsecured—and they became the prized keys the attackers needed to carry out their scheme.

By this point, multiple CEM security procedures had either been ignored or fully bypassed. With João’s cooperation, they infiltrated the company without triggering numerous defense mechanisms. Yet they spent days inside the internal network, ran commands on a corporate machine, and—allegedly—breeched a highly sensitive server without tripping any security alarms. Which, well, is at least bizarre.

But what happened next was even stranger. Armed with legitimate certificates, they issued payment orders against the reserve accounts of several financial institutions. Those reserve accounts hold massive funds for critical needs. In the early hours of July 1, 2025, the reserves began to drain. Since the transactions were signed with trusted certificates, they sailed through without raising any red flags—allowing the criminals to divert about one billion reais. To the system, everything appeared perfectly legitimate, which still makes it hard to pin down exactly how much was stolen.

By the attackers’ skill—or CEM’s failure—no one noticed the theft. But the job wasn’t done: they still had to launder the money. Hundreds of transactions funneled funds into dummy accounts, which were then used to buy cryptocurrencies—untraceable, spendable anywhere. They spread the conversions across multiple crypto exchanges.

What they didn’t count on was SmartPay exchange being vigilant. In the wee hours of the attack, it spotted suspicious activity—and alerted the authorities. SmartPay noticed an unusual spike in new account creation over a short period, followed by a massive, coordinated rush to buy crypto assets from those brand-new accounts. Although those accounts were frozen post-alert, it’s estimated the group escaped with some 200 million reais in crypto.

So far, no members of the gang have been identified or arrested. The former CEM employee wasn’t so lucky: João was arrested on the night of July 3, 2025, and now faces up to 20 years in prison. He’s suspected of accepting 15,000 reais to facilitate the heist and, by his own admission, met with other individuals and helped them break into the system that sent the Pix transfer requests directly to the Central Bank.

Authorities suspect at least four young people were involved—and possibly more. The Central Bank didn’t sit idle, suspending three financial institutions suspected of receiving tainted funds and investigating their ties to the criminals. On Sofi Pagamentos’s Reclame Aqui page—one of the firms under scrutiny—we saw a recent flood of complaints about unauthorized data use, ghost account creations, Pix transfers victims never initiated…all highly suspicious.

Sofi reportedly received around 200 million reais for crypto conversion. And here’s the kicker: the owner of that fintech—who received the millions—was until recently just a cook. In May, he’d become the company’s sole partner after buying all its shares for one million reais. His name is Estevam Paz Bastos, who on social media presents himself as the owner of a fish distribution business in Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul. A company with zero infrastructure to justify such a massive capital inflow.

This attack didn’t come cheap for Brazil—it will leave a historic mark that affects not only our economy but also the country’s reputation. It’s yet another stark reminder of the dangers of not taking digital security seriously.
