One night in March 2025, a simple 48-year-old IT operator was leaving a bar in São Paulo when he was suddenly stopped by a friendly man who wanted to talk about the operator’s job. Days later, he received a call from the same man, offering him five thousand reais in exchange for access to his work systems. The middle-aged man, tempted by the offer, accepted. Four months later, that same man was arrested, accused of launching the largest cyberattack in Brazil.

But the big question is: how did a single key in the hands of a simple technician open a door that millions in technology should have kept locked? How did that small spark ignite a billion-real blaze? Well, in this video we’re going to unravel that mystery.

A hacker attack—a billion-real hacker attack. A hacker attack that can be considered the largest in the history of our national financial system. It netted over one billion reais and is being called the heist of the century. To pull off a theft of that magnitude, the first question the criminals asked themselves wasn’t “How do we break into the bank?” but rather “What’s the easiest path to the money?”

The answer wasn’t in the big banks with their digital walls and specialized security teams. The answer lay with their suppliers—those providing essential services but not always with the same level of protection. Enter CEM Software. The cyberattack was carried out against CEM, which provides services to banks and fintechs. It offers a service known as Banking as a Service, acting as a technology bridge that connects dozens of smaller financial institutions to the Central Bank’s payment system.

Attacking a big bank head-on is like trying to break down the vault door. Attacking CEM is hitting the armored car en route—a classic tactic known in the security world as a supply chain attack. The target was set. Now came the second part of the plan: how to get into the armored car? The easiest way was with the help of someone already inside. They needed an employee, an insider.

Nowadays, finding an employee at any company is frighteningly easy. A simple LinkedIn search turns up dozens of people proudly listing CEM Software as their employer—from directors and managers to analysts and IT operators. To the gang, that list was more than just a roster of employees: it was a menu of potential targets. And on that list of targets, one profile stood out—not for its experience, but for its lack of it. An alleged newcomer to the field. But he wasn’t your typical junior IT guy. He was a 48-year-old man who had worked twenty years as an electrician and four as a cable TV technician.

At 42, he decided to invest in a college degree and transition into information technology. On his LinkedIn profile he wrote: “I’m at an age when many expect to be in C-level positions. But I’m here, eager to start over, with a sparkle in my eye and the enthusiasm of a boy to give my best and learn everything I can.” And that’s where the gang found their golden ticket: João Nazareno Roque—the alleged key to the biggest cyber heist in Brazil.

Everything was well thought out. According to Roque’s testimony, negotiations took place over WhatsApp calls using a phone swapped every 15 days. Payments were delivered by motorcycle couriers. João had no idea who was buying his credentials. And initially, that was all they asked for. But the attackers quickly realized the employee’s passwords alone were useless. To use them, they needed access to CEM’s internal network, which was only possible via a corporate computer with VPN or by being inside the company building.

Faced with that barrier, two weeks after the first deal they offered the employee another ten thousand reais to run some commands on his corporate computer. And, well, he accepted again. It was clear that he used the equipment, glanced at some notes, and entered the commands, which we believe were the malicious code. Under the hackers’ guidance, he downloaded Notion, an online note-taking app that was used to pass code to Roque.

It’s a bit unclear which commands were executed. My theory, as an ethical hacker, is that those commands enabled the hackers to remotely access the IT operator’s computer, which was then used as a pivot—an attack where a compromised machine is used to gain access to an isolated environment, in this case CEM’s internal network. Some investigations concluded that an internal server containing client certificates had a known vulnerability dating back to 2023. Such a critical flaw allowed remote access to that server—a major problem in itself. A 2023 vulnerability still present in a high-risk system is no laughing matter.

But that wasn’t all. That server held unprotected certificates used by clients to authenticate with the Brazilian payment system. So far, it’s unclear whether that vulnerability was actually exploited or if João’s credentials already granted access to the server and its certificates. What is known is that those certificates shouldn’t have been stored like that—and they were the coveted key the attackers needed to carry the scheme forward.

Up to that point, numerous CEM security procedures had either been ignored or completely bypassed. And with João’s help, they managed to infiltrate the company without dealing with most of its defense mechanisms. Yet even then, they remained on the company’s internal network for days. They ran commands on a corporate computer and allegedly breached a highly sensitive server—all without raising the alarm with any security team. Which, well, is at the very least bizarre.

But what came next was even more bizarre. Armed with those legitimate certificates, they issued payment orders against the reserve accounts of financial institutions. These reserve accounts held massive funds and were used when needed. And in the early hours of July 1, 2025, those reserves began to drain. The attack diverted more than 500 million reais from CEM Softwares. Because those transactions were signed with trusted certificates, they went through without much fuss—allowing the criminal group to siphon off about one billion reais in total.

In the system’s eyes, everything was playing out legitimately, which makes it difficult to this day to gauge how much money was actually stolen. Whether by the attackers’ skill or CEM’s failure, no one noticed the theft. But the attack didn’t stop there. They still had to launder the money. Hundreds of transactions were made to various shell accounts—and that money then needed to be converted into cryptocurrencies, which would allow the group to spend it untraceably.

To do that, they used multiple crypto exchanges to handle the conversions. But what they didn’t count on was that the SmartPay exchange was paying attention—and on the night of the attack, they spotted suspicious behavior and reported it to the authorities. The exchange noticed a strange number of accounts being created in a short period. And what stood out even more? A massive, coordinated demand for crypto purchases coming from those newly created accounts. Although those accounts were frozen after the report, it’s estimated the group escaped with around 200 million reais worth of crypto assets.

So far, no member of the group has been identified or arrested—unlike the former CEM employee who was arrested on the night of July 3, 2025, and now faces a lengthy sentence that could reach 20 years in prison. João is suspected of having received 15 thousand reais to assist in the heist, and according to his testimony, he admitted to collaborating with other individuals and helped them gain access to the system that submitted the PIX transfer requests directly to the Central Bank. At least four young people are suspected of being involved in the attack. It’s possible others were involved as well.

The Central Bank didn’t remain idle and suspended three financial institutions suspected of having received funds from the attack. It is now under investigation whether they had any ties to the criminals. On Reclame Aqui for Sofi Pagamentos—one of the companies under investigation—we see that in recent days numerous new complaints have been filed regarding misuse of data, account creations, PIX transactions they didn’t recognize, and similar issues, which is quite odd. Sofi received around 200 million reais to be converted into cryptocurrencies. And one point being raised is that the owner of this fintech—which received millions until recently—was just a cook, and in May of this year he supposedly became the sole shareholder of the company after acquiring all the shares for one million reais.
